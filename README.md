Basic Goals To achieve
1. Using Terraform or AWS Cloudformation, automate the deployment of secure,
publicly available HA Load-Balanced Web Servers that return the instance id
of the host that served the request.

2. Ensure that the web servers are available in two AWS availability zones and
will automatically rebalance themselves if there is no healthy web server
instance in either availability zone.

3.Redirect any HTTP requests to HTTPS. Self-signed certificates are
acceptable.


4.Answer the question: &quot;How would you further automate the management of
the infrastructure if given unlimited time and resource?&quot;
